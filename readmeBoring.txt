How to run it

Linux
- In order to build the project go to root folder and run ./gradlew , after that it should be ready to run
- To run it either Run the Menu from the IDE or try with ./gradlew run ,but personally I was not able to do it since I am using Ubuntu and it seemingly has some issues with running processing sketches

Windows
- To build, run gradlew , after that the project is built
- To run the project You can, again, either Run the Menu from the IDE or run gradlew run from the command line (which will work this time actually)
